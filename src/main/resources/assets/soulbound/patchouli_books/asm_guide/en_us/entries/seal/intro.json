Some seals can be \"activated\", meaning that the wand they are on switches textures and gains buffs and debuffs from it. There are 3 different types of seals, passive, offensive, and amplifying. Passive seals can be activated and are tools, such as pickaxes, axes, hoes, and shovels. Offensive Seals can be activated and are weapons, such as swords, axes, and scythes. Amplifying seals cannot be activated and are used to amplify other amplifying seals or the currently active seal. Some amplifying seals include damage, looting, broom speed, and stack size."
